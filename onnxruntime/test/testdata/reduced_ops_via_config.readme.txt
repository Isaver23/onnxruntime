reduced_ops_via_config.onnx_model_with_included_ops.config contains the ops from
reduced_ops_via_config.onnx_model_with_included_ops, which is intentionally named 
to not have a '.onnx' extension so that the reduced build configuration generation script ignores it. 
The model involves some ops that are not present in any other testdata models (specifically ReduceProd), 
so failure to include the information in the configuration file in a minimal build should result in
 that model being unable to be loaded.

reduced_ops_via_config.onnx_model_with_excluded_ops contains a SampleOp node. As no real model uses 
the internal ORT SampleOp, that model should never be able to be loaded in a minimal build where 
operator reduction was correctly applied, as the reduction should always exclude the SampleOp implementation.
